# Lima TUI

A modern Terminal User Interface for managing Lima VMs, inspired by k9s.

Essentially a TUI created in Go with the tview framework. The idea was to improve the built in `limactl list` command 
with features such as:

- Real-time VM overview
- Intuitive controls for navigation
- VM controls, start/stop/restart
- Connecting to VMs 

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.26+ installed
- Lima installed and working
- Access to `limactl` command

### Build from source
```go
go get .      # Install dependencies
go build .    # Build the binary
go install .  # Install to your $GOBIN path
```

## Usage

```go
# Run the TUI
go run .

# Or if installed globally
lima-tui
```

## Controls

### Navigation
- `↑`/`k` - Move selection up
- `↓`/`j` - Move selection down

### VM Operations
- `Enter`/`Space` - Toggle VM (start if stopped, stop if running)
- `s` - Start selected VM
- `t` - Stop selected VM  
- `r` - Restart selected VM
- `d` - Delete selected VM
- `c` - Connect to VM via SSH

### Management
- `n` - Create new VM (opens external script)
- `R` - Force refresh VM list
- `h`/`?` - Toggle help screen
- `q`/`Ctrl+C` - Quit
